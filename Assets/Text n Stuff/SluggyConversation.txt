Tim: "Hi Sluggy, you look great this afternoon. I was wondering about something I came across as I was doing research. It's called a Horcrux."
Sluggy: "What a surprise, Mr. Roddle! A Horcrux is a powerful object that can help you attain immortality. Creating one allows you to attach part of your soul to the Earth even if your body is destroyed.
Sluggy: "The more that you create, the closer you are to true immortality."
Tim: "How exactly does one create a Horcrux?"
Sluggy: "Only through a truly evil act, such as murder."
Sluggy: "I know your fear of death and lust for power. Perhaps making a Horcrux will help you."
Sluggy: "Your father here is down the hall."
Sluggy: "Kill him with your spells; he is a scum to society, and no one will care if he is gone."
