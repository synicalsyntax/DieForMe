Tim: "Hi Sluggy, you look great this afternoon. I was wondering about something I saw in a book. It's called a horcrux."
Sluggy: "What a surprise, Mr. Roddle! A horcrux is a powerful object that can help you attain immortality. Creating just one allows you to attach part of your soul to the earth even if your body is destroyed.
Sluggy: "The more that you create, the closer you are to true immortality."
Tim: "How exactly does one create a horcrux?"
Sluggy: "Only through a truly evil act--like committing murder."
Sluggy: "I know how much you fear death. Perhaps making a horcrux will help you with your fears."
Sluggy: "I brought your father here today. He is a scum to society. No one will care if he is gone."
Kill your father. He is at the end of this hall.
